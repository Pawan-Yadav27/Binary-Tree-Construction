# Binary-Tree-Construction 
Algorithm takes two input inorder and preorder of tree and outputs indexed preorder and postorder traversal of unique binary tree
Algorithm step- 
Give indexing to inorder array element.
Binary search algorithm used to find the index of each element of preorder array.
Using index of preorder array element construct binary search tree ,then replace index by element.
which is unique binay tree constructed by givan preorder and inorder.
