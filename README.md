# Binary-Tree-Construction 
Attached code takes two input inorder and preorder of tree. 
Algorithm step- 
Give indexing to inorder array element , and then sort the inorder array using{construct two dimention array (element , index)}.
Binary search algorithm used to find the index of each element of preorder array.
Using index of preorder array element construct binary search tree ,then replace index by element.
which is unique binay tree constructed by givan preorder and inorder.
Program prints indexed preorder and postorder traversal of unique binary tree.
